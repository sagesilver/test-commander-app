# Test Commander: Design Specification

## 1. Architecture Overview

Test Commander is a modular, cloud-native, web-based application, designed for extensibility and rapid evolution. The architecture separates the frontend (UI), backend (API/database), and future pluggable modules.

---

## 2. Frontend

### **Framework**
- **React.js** (with hooks and functional components)

### **Component Library & Styling**
- **Material UI** or **shadcn/ui** for prebuilt, accessible UI components.
- **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, custom, utility-first styling.
- **Framer Motion** for animations and smooth UI transitions.

### **State Management**
- **React Context API** for light shared state.
- **Redux Toolkit** (only if large-scale, cross-tree state management is needed).

### **Routing**
- **React Router** for page/component routing.

### **Forms & Validation**
- **React Hook Form** for flexible, performant form handling.
- **Yup** for schema validation.

### **Data Fetching**
- **Firebase SDK** for real-time data sync, queries, and updates.

### **Authentication**
- **Firebase Authentication** for email/password, social, or SSO login.
- Optional: Integrate with OAuth2/OpenID providers if needed.

### **File Upload & Attachments**
- **Firebase Storage** for handling uploads and serving files.

### **Rich Text/Markdown Editing**
- **react-quill** or **@uiw/react-md-editor** for description and notes fields.

---

## 3. Backend

### **Database**
- **Firebase Firestore** (NoSQL, real-time, scalable, strong offline support).

### **File/Attachment Storage**
- **Firebase Storage** for all uploaded documents, images, logs, and artifacts.

### **Serverless Functions**
- **Firebase Cloud Functions** for custom backend logic (e.g., notifications, scheduled tasks, integration endpoints).

### **Authentication & Authorization**
- **Firebase Auth** for managing users and securing endpoints.
- Custom claims/roles for admin/user/other roles.

### **Search**
- Use Firestoreâ€™s built-in indexing for simple search.
- Integrate **Algolia** for advanced, full-text, typo-tolerant search (optional, upgrade path).

### **Reporting & Analytics**
- Use Firestore queries for live data.
- For complex/aggregated reports:  
  - Implement in Cloud Functions or generate via client-side aggregation.
  - **Chart.js** or **Recharts** for frontend graphs/dashboards.

### **Audit Trail & Logging**
- Store audit logs/history as subcollections in Firestore.

---

## 4. Extensibility

### **Modular Codebase**
- Use a plug-in/module pattern for additional features (test automation, requirements management, etc.).
- Component-level code splitting and lazy loading in React.

### **API Integration**
- **REST** and **gRPC** endpoints via Cloud Functions.
- **Webhooks** for outbound integration (e.g., Slack, Teams, CI/CD pipelines).

---

## 5. Deployment & DevOps

### **Hosting**
- **Firebase Hosting** for the React SPA (HTTPS, CDN-backed, custom domains).

### **CI/CD**
- **GitHub Actions** or **GitLab CI** for build, test, and deployment automation.
- Auto-deploy to Firebase on `main/master` branch merge.

### **Environment Configuration**
- Use Firebase environment configs for API keys, secrets, etc.

### **Monitoring & Error Tracking**
- **Firebase Performance Monitoring** for frontend and backend metrics.
- **Sentry** (optional) for advanced error tracking in production.

---

## 6. Testing

### **Unit/Integration Testing**
- **Jest** and **React Testing Library** for UI/components.
- **Cypress** for end-to-end/integration testing.

### **Linting & Formatting**
- **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code quality and style enforcement.

---

## 7. Accessibility & Internationalisation

### **Accessibility**
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance by default via Material UI/shadcn/ui.
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA roles where appropriate.

### **i18n**
- **react-i18next** if internationalisation is required.

---

## 8. Optional & Future Tech

- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** support for offline use.
- **Mobile App** (later): React Native for shared codebase with web.
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API for future smart reporting or natural language features.
