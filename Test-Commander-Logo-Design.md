Here’s a **logo design prompt** tailored for Test Commander, designed to produce a modern, flexible logo suitable for a cutting-edge React web app, and visually compatible with both light and dark backgrounds. This leverages your style and colour scheme requirements, the product’s mission, and current UI/UX principles:

---

**Design a modern, professional logo for a software test management application named "Test Commander".**

**Key Requirements:**

* **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 (horizontal, suitable for app headers and favicons)
* **Transparency:** Must look crisp as a transparent PNG over both light and dark backgrounds (test against #f7f9fa and #23272f backgrounds)
* **Typography:** Use a clean, geometric sans-serif font—think Inter, Segoe UI, or Roboto. Lettering should feel high-trust, accessible, and technical, with subtle custom shaping for the “T” and “C” to hint at testing or checkmark motifs.
* **Iconography:** Integrate a minimalist, abstract symbol—such as a stylised checkmark, ticked box, or grid/table—seamlessly with the text or as a standalone mark. Optionally, use overlapping shapes or lines to evoke “command”, organisation, or test cycles.
* **Colour Palette:**

  * Primary blue: #3762c4 (main), #eaf2fb (light), #22386b (dark)
  * Slate grey: #606a78, #23272f (for text or accents)
  * Teal accent: #36b1ae (for highlights)
  * **Avoid bold/saturated colours; favour subtle gradients or gentle highlights.**
* **Style:** Flat, uncluttered, with generous whitespace. Rounded corners and soft shadows preferred. No harsh outlines or heavy gradients. Should look sleek and contemporary, fit for a SaaS dashboard.
* **Adaptability:** Should be instantly recognisable at small and large sizes, and work as an app icon, sidebar, or browser tab.

**Mood & Message:**

* Instil trust, clarity, and technical competence.
* Reflect Test Commander’s focus on quality, automation, and streamlined team workflows.
* Subtly suggest “control”, “testing”, and “structure” without overt cliches.

**Don’ts:**

* No bold or garish colours.
* Avoid legacy symbols like bugs, clipboards, or old-school checklists.
* Don’t use photographic elements or complex gradients.

**Deliverables:**

* 16:9 transparent PNG version, optimised for both light and dark backgrounds.

**Prompt for AI logo generator or designer:**

> Design a modern, professional logo for "Test Commander", a SaaS test management platform. Use a 16:9 ratio. Combine a clean geometric sans-serif font (like Inter or Roboto) with a minimalist symbol (such as a stylised checkmark, ticked grid, or control panel). Colours: use primary blue (#3762c4), slate grey (#606a78/#23272f), and a teal accent (#36b1ae). The design should be flat, uncluttered, and adaptable—avoid harsh gradients or busy details. Ensure the logo is crisp and readable on both light (#f7f9fa) and dark (#23272f) backgrounds. Deliver as a transparent PNG. The logo should suggest trust, technical excellence, and modern workflow automation.
